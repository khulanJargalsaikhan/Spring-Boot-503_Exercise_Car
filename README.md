# Spring Boot 503 Exercise


Instruction:
-------------
Prepare a security-ready application that can display a list of cars. Each car should have AT LEAST the following fields:

- Model

- Make

- Description

- Photo

Use Bootstrap to share the same navbar across all pages.

Bonus 1: Preload some cars in your CommandLineRunner class. You will need to upload your picture to cloudinary first, and use the url as the photo field.

Bonus 2: Make it so Cars can have no photo. If no photo is inserted, set the photo field to an empty string.
